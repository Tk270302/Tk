 Developed and evaluated time-series and machine learning models to forecast GDP of BRICS countries using data from
 1980–2023.
 Compared three models: SARIMAX, Hybrid SARIMAX-XGBoost, and LSTM for predictive performance using
 exogenous economic indicators.
 Designed a hybrid forecasting model integrating SARIMAX (for trend modeling) and XGBoost (for residual
 correction), which outperformed standalone approaches.
 Built and trained a deep learning LSTM network to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies with sequence data.
 Applied feature engineering (lag creation, growth rates), normalization, and residual diagnostics for model robustness.
 Evaluated models using MAE, RMSE, MSE, AIC, BIC, R², and conducted SHAP analysis for explainability in
 ensemble models.
 Achieved the highest forecast accuracy with the hybrid model, offering both interpretability and nonlinear correction
 capability.
 Tools used: Python, Statsmodels, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotli
